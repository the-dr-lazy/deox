# Introduction

Deox is the only completely functional **type-safe** approach to Flux that its main goals are to diminish types **verbosity**, **repetition** and **complexity** without losing any type information (type-safe alternative of [redux-actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions)).

Behold, the art of `deox`:

## Highlights

- **Minimalist** (almost no import cost) - checkout [Bundle Phobia](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=deox@latest).
- **Simple** - focused on self-declarative API.
- **Secure** - complete test-suits for all of the edge and corners.
- **Actively maintained** - monitoring issues and respond in a timely manner.

Now you know the motivation behind the Deox. Let's [**get started**](/getting-started)!
