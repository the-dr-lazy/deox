# Getting Started

Deox is the utility belt for [FSA](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action)-compliant actions
that can be used together with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [NGRX](https://ngrx.io/)/[NGXS](https://ngxs.gitbook.io/ngxs).

## Installation

For [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) users:

```application/x-sh
yarn add deox
```

For [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) users:

```application/x-sh
npm install --save deox
```

The Deox NPM package contains a [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/specs/modules/1.0/) build
that can be used with [Node](https://nodejs.org/) application or module bundlers (e.g. [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup), [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), etc.).
it also includes an [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) build that works well with [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/).

> **Typescript tip**: notice that Deox internally uses some **ES2015** type definitions to represent better developer experience.
> So if you are using [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) and targeting `es5`, be sure `es2015` lib has been added in the tsconfig.json:

```application/json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["es2105"]
  }
}
```

If you don't use module bundler, it's also fine.
The Deox NPM package also includes a production minified [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build that makes Deox available as global variable called `window.Deox`;
you can add it simply to your page via following script tag:

```xml
<script src="https://unpkg.com/deox@latest"></script>
```

## Basic Usage

Deox provides lots of helpful utility functions and types to **help you reduce Flux boilerplate**;
You can see all of these utilities at API reference page.

The most important utility functions that Deox provides are:

- `createActionCreator`: creates an **action creator** by given action type (AKA `createAction`)
- `createReducer`: creates a **reducer** by given default state and an array of action handlers

Let's see the famous simple counter example:

```ts
import { createActionCreator, createReducer } from 'deox'

const increment = createActionCreator('INCREMENT')
const decrement = createActionCreator('DECREMENT')
const reset = createActionCreator('RESET', resolve => (count: number) =>
  resolve(count)
)

const defaultState = 0

const counter = createReducer(defaultState, handle => [
  handle(increment, state => state + 1),
  handle(decrement, state => state - 1),
  handle(reset, (_, { payload }) => payload),
])

counter(undefined, increment()) //=> 1
counter(undefined, decrement()) //=> -1
counter(3, reset(0)) //=> 0
```

It's that simple but there is a hidden feature in the above example that makes Deox wonderful.
Although there isn't any type notation in the above example but there is full **type-safety**.
How? It's Magic!
